# The release port's dry-run divergences from `release.sh`

**Run 2026-09-06, against umbrella `4b6885f`, `botmaker-cli` at `cb267aa`.** Fourteen flag combinations,
both implementations, stdout diffed after stripping ANSI colour and the script's `==> ` narration prefix.

**Result: 14 of 14 combinations differ.** The claim in `com.botmaker.cli.release`'s `package-info.java` —
*"the plan's cutover test passes — the script's `--dry-run` and this library's agree across the flag
matrix"* — was **not true when it was written** and is corrected in the same commit as this file.

**But nothing in the diff is a decision.** Every module chosen, every version computed, every skip, every
gate verdict and every refusal message is byte-identical, including the two gates added on 2026-09-06. The
divergences are all in *narration, ordering and echo form*. That is a materially better position than "the
diffs are empty" would have been if it had been true by accident, and it is also not the cutover condition
the plan wrote down.

## How it was run

```bash
./release.sh <flags> --dry-run
java -jar botmaker-cli/target/botmaker-cli-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar release <flags>
```

The matrix: `--all`, `--all minor`, each of the ten module flags alone, `--sdk 1.1.7 --studio 1.0.38` (the
pair the Phase 1 forcing gate exists to require), and `--studio-api 0.0.5 --plugin-toolkit 0.0.6
--plugin-host 0.0.6 --cli 0.0.10` (a contract release with everything it forces).

Exit codes agreed in all fourteen.

## What agrees, stated first because it is the load-bearing half

| Compared | Result |
|---|---|
| Which modules a run cuts | identical, all 14 |
| The version each gets, patch and minor | identical |
| Skip decisions and their reasons | identical |
| Every gate's *verdict* (ok / not checked / FORCED / refused) | identical |
| Every refusal's *text*, word for word | identical |
| Exit code | identical, all 14 |

The two 2026-09-06 gates are exact. `--sdk 1.1.7` alone refuses in both with the same paragraph, naming
`--studio` and the same reason (`the release bumps MavenService.SDK_FALLBACK_VERSION, so Studio's own
source changes — without a Studio release, freshly created bots keep pinning the previous SDK`), and
`--sdk 1.1.7 --studio 1.0.38` proceeds past it in both.

## The divergences

Ranked by whether they can change what a real release *does*, not by diff size.

### D1 — the umbrella pointer commit is worded differently. **Writes something. Fix before cutover.**

`./release.sh --plugin-archetype 0.0.5` commits the umbrella as `release: archetype v0.0.5`; the port
commits `release: plugin-archetype v0.0.5`. Same for the toolkit: the script says `toolkit`, the port says
`plugin-toolkit`. The submodule's own commit uses the full directory name in **both**, so only the umbrella
subject and the run's last line differ.

The script keeps a hand-written label per module (`release.sh:2101-2110`); the port derives it in
`Module.shortName()` as the directory minus `botmaker-`. The port's is more consistent and the script's is
what every umbrella release commit in this repository's history says.

**Verdict: the maintainer's call, and it is the only divergence that reaches a permanent artifact.** Either
give `Module` a short-name table matching the script, or change the script's two labels and accept the
history seam. Do not cut over while they disagree.

### D2 — the gates run in a different order. **Fix in the port; mechanical.**

| | order |
|---|---|
| `release.sh` (`:1861-1894`) | forcing → fallback → **sdk gates** → ci-deps → jitpack-plugins → **changelog** |
| `Gates.run` | forcing → fallback → **changelog** → ci-deps → jitpack-plugins → **sdk gates** |

No verdict changes; the lines appear in a different sequence. The port's ordering has no stated reason in
its javadoc, and the script's does — the SDK gates run Maven, so an operator learns about a cheap refusal
first only by accident either way. Reorder `Gates.run` to match; it is five statements.

### D3 — the port runs every gate; the script stops at the first refusal. **Deliberate. Decide what the test means.**

`Gates.java`'s own javadoc: *"All of them run even after one refuses… the script stops at its first `die`;
this reports the whole list, because the operator is about to go and fix something and a second refusal
discovered on the next run is a second round trip."*

That is a real improvement and it makes an empty stdout diff **impossible** for any refusing run — five of
the fourteen. Visible cleanly in `--shared 1.1.1`: the script prints the forcing refusal and stops; the port
prints four more `— ok` lines and then the same refusal.

**Verdict: keep the behaviour, change the cutover test.** The test that survives is *decisions and refusal
texts agree*, which is what §"What agrees" above measures. An empty stdout diff was never the property worth
having; it was a proxy for it.

### D4 — three narration lines the port never prints. **Fix in the port; one line each.**

- `DRY RUN — no changes will be made.` (`release.sh:485`) — missing in **all fourteen**.
- `(dry-run) would verify on JitPack: <specs>` (`release.sh:1511`) — missing wherever JitPack builds the
  module.
- `botmaker-studio v1.0.38 tagged — its package matrix runs in parallel with the chain below.` — missing.

The first is the one that matters: a preview that does not say it is a preview is the wrong thing to omit
from a tool whose entire safety argument is "run it dry first".

### D5 — the port prints a `Gates:` heading the script has not. **Cosmetic; drop it or add it to the script.**

### D6 — command echoes are not shell-quoted, and the idempotence wrappers are invisible.

Script: `$ bash -c git -C '…' rev-parse -q --verify 'refs/tags/v0.0.10' >/dev/null || git -C '…' tag 'v0.0.10'`
Port: `$ git -C … tag v0.0.10`

The port implements the same idempotence in Java (`CommitTagPush`) and echoes only the effective command.
The echoed line is therefore **not copy-pasteable** and no longer shows the guard. `Runner.run` joins argv
with spaces and quotes nothing, so a commit subject containing a space echoes as bare words:
`$ git -C … commit -am release: studio v1.0.38`.

**Verdict: quote the echo.** The behaviour is right; the transcript is misleading, and a dry run's output is
read as a script by whoever is checking it.

### D7 — file writes elide the body, and always say `DEPS_EOF`.

`Runner.write` prints `$ cat > <path> <<'DEPS_EOF' … DEPS_EOF` where the script prints the whole heredoc.
Deliberate, and documented — *"the interesting part of a `.deps.env` is the pins, and those are printed by
the line above it"* — which is fair for `.deps.env` and wrong for the other caller: the changelog stamp
prints `cat > …/CHANGELOG.md <<'DEPS_EOF' … DEPS_EOF`, naming a marker that has nothing to do with a
changelog.

### D8 — the changelog stamp is a different operation. **Worth a second look.**

Script: `sed -i '0,/^## \[Unreleased\]/s//## [1.0.38] — 2026-09-06/' <file>` — a bounded in-place edit of
the first matching line.
Port: rewrites the whole file through `Runner.write`.

Same intended result, and the port's is the riskier shape: a whole-file rewrite of a file the maintainer
has been editing loses anything the port's reader did not model (final newline, CRLF, encoding). Not
observed to differ here — the stamped output was not compared byte for byte, because the dry run does not
write. **This is the one divergence this matrix did not actually test**, and it should be tested before
cutover by stamping a copy with both and diffing.

### D9 — the push pass reports differently.

Script computes each repository's ahead-count in the dry run and lists only those that are ahead:
`botmaker-cli: 'main' is 4 commit(s) ahead of origin/main`. The port prints
`(dry-run) would push <module> if it is ahead of origin` for all eleven, because `Umbrella.pushBranch`
returns early on `runner.dryRun()` before reading git at all.

**Verdict: fix in the port.** Reading `rev-list --count` is not a side effect, and the script's line is
strictly more informative — it is the difference between "eleven repositories might get pushed" and "these
five will".

### D10 — a trailing space.

`  pinning botmaker-cli to STUDIO_API_TAG=v0.0.4 PLUGIN_HOST_TAG=v0.0.5 ` — the script leaves one, the port
strips it. Listed only because a stdout diff sees it.

## Where this leaves the cutover

`package-info.java` states the condition as *every slice's dry-run diff empty **and** one full `--all` cut
through the library*. On the evidence above:

1. **The first half is unreachable as written**, because D3 is a behaviour the port should keep. Restate it:
   *the decisions, the gate verdicts and the refusal texts agree across the matrix* — which they now
   demonstrably do.
2. **D1 must be settled first regardless**, because it is the one divergence that writes a permanent commit
   subject, and the umbrella's release history is the thing that would carry the seam.
3. **D8 needs the test this matrix could not run**: stamp a copy of a real `CHANGELOG.md` with both
   implementations and diff the files, not the narration.
4. D2, D4, D6, D7, D9 are small and one-directional — the port is missing or mangling something the script
   says. Fixing them costs an afternoon and removes most of the diff.
5. **`.github/workflows/release.yml:151` still invokes `./release.sh`, and should stay that way** until
   1–3 are settled and one single-module release has been cut through the library and watched end to end.
   A tag is permanent and no exit code recalls one.

## Reproducing

The matrix script is not committed — it is fourteen invocations of the two commands at the top of this
file, with `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'` on both and `sed 's/^==> //'` on the script's. Re-run it after any
change to either implementation; it needs network (both fetch tags) and about eight minutes, most of it
Maven inside the two SDK gates.
