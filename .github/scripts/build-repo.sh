# Builds the static dnf + apt repository published to GitHub Pages, out of the .rpm/.deb this release just

# version arrives with the rest of their system updates.

# THE PACKAGES THEMSELVES ARE HOSTED HERE, both formats — which is where this differs from
# botmaker-studio's otherwise identical script. There, each package is ~240 MB against a ~1 GB Pages soft
# limit, so the .rpm is staged only long enough for createrepo_c to hash it and `--baseurl` then points
# clients at the GitHub release CDN. This package is about 1 MB: the offload buys nothing and costs the one
# thing that went wrong there, a --baseurl spelling that leaves clients 404ing on a file deleted a line ago.
#
# ONLY EVER THE LATEST RELEASE. This is an upgrade channel, not an archive — every older version stays
# downloadable as a GitHub Release asset — and the deploy is a fresh artifact each time, so nothing
# accumulates.
#
# SIGNING is at the repository level: repodata/repomd.xml.asc for dnf, a clearsigned InRelease plus a
# detached Release.gpg for apt. That is a signature over the index, and an index carries the checksum of
# every package it lists, so it is a signature over the payload as well — which is why the packages
# themselves are not separately signed (see packaging/nfpm.yaml). With signing unconfigured the repository
# is still built and the generated snippets turn the checks off, so what is published stays
# self-consistent; that path is for dry runs, not for a real release.

<h1>botmaker</h1>
<p class="sub">dnf and apt repositories for <strong>${TAG}</strong>. Install once, then update with your
package manager like anything else on the system.</p>

<h2>Fedora / RHEL</h2>
<pre><code>${DNF_SNIPPET}</code></pre>

<h2>Debian / Ubuntu</h2>
<pre><code>${APT_SNIPPET}</code></pre>

<p>Later updates, either way: <code>sudo dnf upgrade botmaker</code> or
<code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade botmaker</code>.</p>

<h2>Anywhere else</h2>
<p>One jar, every OS: <code>jbang botmaker@LiQiyeDev</code>, or download
<code>botmaker-cli-all.jar</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/${REPO_SLUG}/releases">Releases</a> page and run it with
<code>java -jar</code>.</p>

<footer>
<p>The package installs the jar at <code>/usr/share/botmaker/</code> and a launcher at
<code>/usr/bin/botmaker</code>, and requires a Java 25 runtime. Maven is a recommended dependency rather
than a required one: every verb that resolves a coordinate shells out to your own <code>mvn</code>, and
the ones that do not need none.</p>
<p>This repository carries the <strong>latest release only</strong> — it is an upgrade channel, not an
archive.</p>
