/**
 * {@code botmaker} — the entry point.
 *
 * <p>Four verbs about a plugin, and — since 2026-09-04 — one noun about a bot ({@link BotCommand}). The
 * shape of the verb set is the argument for the tool existing at all: {@code new} and
 * {@code publish} are the two ends of a plugin's life, and {@code validate} and {@code run} are the loop in
 * between. Each of them is something an author can do today by hand — {@code mvn archetype:generate} with
 * eight properties, {@code mvn install} then a pom edit then a Studio launch, a hand-written
 * {@code index.json} row — and each is something they will get wrong the first time in a way that produces
 * no error until much later.
 *
 * <p><b>Exit codes are a contract, because CI reads them.</b> {@code 0} success, {@code 1} the thing failed,
 * {@code 2} the command line was wrong. A validation failure is {@code 1} and not {@code 2}: a plugin that
 * does not pass is a well-formed question with a bad answer. picocli's {@code ExitCode.USAGE} is already 2,
 * and a subcommand's returned {@code Integer} is the exit code, so the contract holds without being restated.
 *
 * <p><b>Why picocli, in a program that otherwise takes no dependency it can avoid.</b> This was hand-rolled
 * first — sixty lines of parsing, a usage text as a Java text block, and a table listing every option each
 * verb accepts. Those are <em>three statements of one fact</em>, and nothing made them agree: the first real
 * invocation of {@code new} passed an option that did not exist, which was silently ignored, generated a
 * project pinned to something else and said so nowhere. Here the usage text is the same annotated fields
 * that parse, so it cannot fall behind them, and an unrecognised option is refused with a suggestion rather
 * than dropped. The dependency is declared {@code optional} in the pom: the shaded jar carries it and the
 * plugin registry, which resolves the main artifact as a library, does not.
