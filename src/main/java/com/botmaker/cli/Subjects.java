/**
 * Turning "this directory" or "this coordinate" into the resolved facts {@code PluginValidator} needs.
 *
 * <p>Every process spawn and every download in validation happens here, which is what lets the validator
 * itself be a pure library with two callers in two repositories. The two entry points are deliberately
 * different questions: {@link #fromDirectory} validates the build in front of you, and
 * {@link #fromCoordinate} validates what the world can actually download — the one the registry's CI asks,
 * and the only one that catches a plugin that works locally and publishes a pom nobody can resolve.
 *
 * <p><b>Public, and only {@link #fromCoordinate} is.</b> The registry's gate
 * ({@link com.botmaker.cli.registry.RegistryGate}) resolves a published coordinate through this same class,
 * so that "the gate downloads what a bot project would download" is one implementation rather than two.
 * {@link #fromDirectory} stays package-private: a working copy is the author's question, and the registry
 * has no working copy to ask about.
