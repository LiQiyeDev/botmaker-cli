/**
 * {@code botmaker plugin} — the first of the two nouns.
 *
 * <p>These four verbs were the top level until 2026-09-05: {@code botmaker new}, {@code validate},
 * {@code run}, {@code publish}. They meant <em>plugin</em>, and nothing in the command line said so — while
 * the other half of the platform already had to spell its noun ({@code botmaker bot new}). So the most-typed
 * verb in the program belonged to one of the two things a user creates, and {@code --help} was the only
 * place that fact was written down.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix is symmetry, and it was taken as a break rather than as an alias.</b> The install base is a
 * dnf/apt repository days old and the tool is v0.x; a permanent second spelling of every verb is a worse
 * thing to carry than one rename. The four old paths survive only as {@link MovedCommand} — hidden, running
 * nothing, printing where the verb went and exiting 2 — because the difference between
 * {@code Unmatched argument: 'validate'} and {@code moved: use `botmaker plugin validate`} is the whole
 * value of a break somebody has to notice.
 *
 * <p>A noun holds no state of its own: the three collaborators are {@link Main}'s, built once there because
 * {@code --quiet} is not known until parsing is done.
