/**
 * One plugin's row in the registry's {@code index.json}.
 *
 * <p><b>The registry is a curated index, not a security boundary, and this record is where that sentence has
 * to be true.</b> Every field here is either what a coordinate resolves to or what the validator observed;
 * none of them is a claim about what the plugin <em>does</em> once loaded, because a plugin runs arbitrary
 * code in Studio's process and no amount of loading it proves anything about that. {@code verifiedAt} says
 * the checks ran on a date, and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>Field order is fixed by {@link JsonPropertyOrder} so that a pull request adding an entry is a diff of
 * one block rather than a reshuffle. Nulls are omitted for the same reason: an entry that leaves out
 * {@code tags} should not carry a line saying so.
