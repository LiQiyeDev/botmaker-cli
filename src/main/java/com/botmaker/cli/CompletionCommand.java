/**
 * {@code botmaker completion} — prints the shell completion script on stdout.
 *
 * <p><b>Generated from the same annotated fields that parse, which is the whole reason it is a command
 * rather than a checked-in script.</b> A hand-written completion file is the third statement of one fact —
 * beside the parser and the usage text — and it is the one nothing tests: it does not fail, it just stops
 * offering an option somebody added, or keeps offering one they removed. That is the argument this program
 * already made for taking picocli at all (see {@link Main}), applied to the shell.
 *
 * <p><b>bash and zsh from one script.</b> picocli emits bash, and zsh runs it through its own
 * {@code bashcompinit}, which is what the two install lines below do. No fish or PowerShell: picocli
 * generates neither, and a hand-written one for those would be exactly the drifting file this avoids.
 *
 * <p><b>stdout is the script and nothing else</b>, the same rule {@code publish --dry-run} follows, so
 * {@code botmaker completion > /path} is a working install and the packages can generate the file by
 * running the command rather than by carrying a copy of it.
