/**
 * The blank bot project {@code botmaker bot new} writes: a pom, one {@code main}, and the template
 * declaration.
 *
 * <h2>It names no plugin, and that is the whole point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Since 2026-09-04 a project Studio creates names no plugin either — no SDK, no toolkit, no JavaFX. The
 * platform's rule is that the SDK is one plugin among any number, so a starting point that names it is a
 * starting point that has already chosen one, which is a choice belonging to whoever is starting. The
 * repositories are declared all the same, so the project can <em>become</em> a bot without anybody
 * hand-editing XML: <b>Project ▸ Manage Plugins</b> adds the SDK as an ordinary dependency and it resolves.
 *
 * <h2>This duplicates Studio's {@code MavenService.blankPomXml} and {@code StarterSources}, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code botmaker-studio} is an application, not a library: there is nothing to depend on, and depending
 * on it would mean pulling JavaFX, OpenCV and JNA into a command whose promise is a single jar. The
 * precedent is {@code validate/StubContexts}, which re-writes the toolkit's {@code TestContexts} for the
 * same reason and says so in its own javadoc. Both copies write a project whose whole point is that nothing
 * maintains it afterwards — there is no ongoing agreement to keep, only the shape of a first commit — and if
 * the two drift, the cost is that two blank projects differ in a comment.
 *
 * <h2>Text, not {@code maven-model}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Studio composes its pom through the Maven Model API so a project name containing an {@code &} cannot
 * produce a file that does not parse. Here the name is a command-line argument and is <b>refused</b> unless
 * it is a Maven-safe identifier, which answers the same question one step earlier and costs no dependency.
