/**
 * The eight things asked of a plugin, in the order they are asked.
 *
 * <p><b>An enum rather than seven strings, and the reason is the whole point of this package.</b> Two
 * programs in two repositories report these: the author's {@code botmaker validate} and the registry's CI on
 * a pull request. A check named in one place and spelled differently in the other is a PR that fails for a
 * reason its author could not have seen coming, which is exactly what the gate exists to prevent. So the
 * name and the sentence live here, once, and both readers print what they are given.
 *
 * <p>The order is a dependency order, not a preference: nothing can be said about a plugin's palette until
 * it has loaded, and nothing can be said about anything until the classpath resolves. A run stops at the
 * first {@link Status#FAIL} whose successors would be meaningless, and says so.
