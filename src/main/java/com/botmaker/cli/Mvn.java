/**
 * Running Maven, which is the only way this CLI resolves anything.
 *
 * <p><b>Shelling out rather than embedding a resolver.</b> Maven Resolver as a library would let the CLI
 * resolve a coordinate in-process, and it would resolve it against <em>its own</em> idea of the local
 * repository, the mirrors and the settings — which is not the user's. The whole promise of {@code validate}
 * is that it answers what the registry will answer, and the way to keep that promise is for both to run the
 * same build tool the author already has configured. It also keeps the shaded jar small enough to be worth
 * shipping as one file.
 *
 * <p>A wrapper wins when there is one: a project carrying {@code mvnw} has said which Maven it wants, and
 * ignoring that is how a build behaves differently under this tool than under the author's own hands.
