/**
 * {@code botmaker doctor} — every external thing this program needs, answered at once.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it exists.</b> Nothing here is a new capability: each verb already reports the tool it is
 * missing. It reports it <em>at the moment it is needed</em>, which is halfway through the first real use —
 * {@code plugin publish} discovers there is no {@code gh} after building, validating and resolving a
 * coordinate, and {@code plugin run} discovers there is no Studio after a full {@code mvn install}. The set
 * is small and knowable up front, so this asks the whole of it in about a second, and it is the natural
 * first thing to paste into a bug report.
 *
 * <p><b>It reaches no network and changes nothing.</b> A version probe is a process, not a request: the
 * question "can this machine run the other verbs" must be answerable on a train.
 *
 * <p>The report is the command's <em>result</em>, so it goes to stdout — the same rule {@link Console}
 * opens with, which is why {@code plugin publish --dry-run} can be redirected into a file.
