/**
 * The four verbs that moved under {@link PluginCommand} on 2026-09-05, kept only to say where they went.
 *
 * <p><b>It does not delegate, and that is the point.</b> An alias is a second spelling to carry forever and
 * a second thing every example has to choose between; this runs nothing and exits 2 — the command line was
 * wrong — with one line naming the replacement. What it buys over deleting the verbs outright is the
 * difference between picocli's {@code Unmatched argument: 'validate'} and {@code moved: use `botmaker plugin
 * validate`}, for a tool whose install base arrives through dnf and apt and updates on its own schedule.
 *
 * <p>Delete this class at 1.0.0.
 *
 * <p>One class rather than four: the verbs are registered as aliases of one command, so the replacement is a
 * lookup rather than four near-identical files. Which alias was typed is read back off the root's original
 * arguments — picocli reports the command's primary name, not the alias, and the message has to name the
 * verb the person actually wrote.
