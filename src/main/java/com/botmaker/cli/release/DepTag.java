/**
 * The git ref a downstream build should pin an upstream module to — {@code release.sh}'s {@code dep_tag}.
 *
 * <p>Two cases, and the first is why this is not simply "the newest tag": when <b>this run</b> is releasing
 * the module, the pin is the version being cut, which does not exist as a tag yet at the moment the
 * downstream's {@code .deps.env} is written. Reading the repository there would pin the <i>previous</i>
 * release, and the downstream would be published resolving an upstream it was not built against.
 *
 * <p>That is the guess this file replaced. Five {@code .deps.env} values were once
 * {@code git ls-remote --tags | sort -V | tail -1} — "newest tag", which is only <i>usually</i> "the tag
 * this release just cut".
 *
 * <p><b>The ref name is probed, not composed.</b> Tags here are {@code v1.2.3} and the SDK's older ones are
 * bare {@code 1.2.3}; a pin naming a ref that does not exist fails the downstream's JitPack build, which is
 * cached per tag and so cannot be repaired without cutting another one.
