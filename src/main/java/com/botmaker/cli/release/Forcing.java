/**
 * One reason a module being released drags another one with it — {@code release.sh}'s {@code forced} flags,
 * as data.
 *
 * <p><b>The script spells these as an expression per module</b>
 * ({@code [[ -n "$SHARED_VER$SESSION_VER$STUDIOAPI_VER$TOOLKIT_VER" ]]}), with the <i>why</i> in a comment
 * above it. That is the one thing worth changing in the port rather than transcribing: the reasons are the
 * hard-won part — every one of them records a bug that shipped — and a comment cannot be printed to the
 * operator who is asking why a module they did not name is in the plan. So an edge carries its own sentence
 * and {@link #forcedBy} hands it back.
 *
 * <p><b>The set of edges is transcribed exactly, comment for comment.</b> Adding or dropping one here is a
 * release that differs from the script's, which is what the slice diff exists to catch.
 *
 * <p>Two modules are forced by <b>nothing</b> and it is deliberate in both cases. {@code botmaker-shared}
 * and {@code botmaker-studio-api} sit at the top of the graph and pin nothing of ours; and
 * {@code botmaker-plugin-archetype} <i>ships text</i>, whose BotMaker versions are archetype
 * {@code requiredProperties} defaulting to {@code main-SNAPSHOT} — there is no pin in it for a contract
 * release to invalidate. {@code botmaker-pilot} is likewise independent: no pom pin, no JitPack.
 *
 * @param upstream   the module whose release triggers this
 * @param downstream the module dragged in
 * @param reason     why, in the present tense, as the operator should read it
