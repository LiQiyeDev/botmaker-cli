/**
 * The decide pass: what a set of flags would actually release — {@code release.sh}'s {@code resolve_version}
 * loop, its {@code Release plan:} block and its {@code decide} calls, assembled.
 *
 * <p><b>Every decision is taken here, before anything is tagged, and that ordering is the point.</b>
 * {@code should_release} used to be evaluated inline, immediately before each module was tagged, which
 * forced the tag order to equal the decision order and put Studio — the longest job in the release — last,
 * behind three JitPack waits. Deciding up front frees {@link Order#TAG}. It also means a refusal happens
 * while nothing has been pushed, which is the only time a refusal is worth anything: a pushed tag cannot be
 * edited.
 *
 * <p><b>A skipped module's version is cleared</b>, so the forcing rules, the {@code .deps.env} pins and the
 * pointer commit all see the final answer rather than the requested one.
 *
 * <p>This class computes and prints; it writes nothing. Handing its {@link #releasing()} to the writers is
 * the caller's job, and it is what keeps a preview honest — the plan is produced by the same pass either
 * way.
