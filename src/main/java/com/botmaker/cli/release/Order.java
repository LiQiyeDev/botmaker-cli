/**
 * The two orders a release runs in, and they are not the same order — nor either the order
 * {@link Module} declares.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #DECIDE} is dependency order and has to be.</b> Each module's forced flag is computed from
 * the versions decided <i>so far</i> ({@link Forcing}), so an upstream must be answered before anything it
 * drags in. A skipped module has its version cleared here, which is what makes the downstream flags, the
 * {@code .deps.env} pins and the pointer commit all see the final answer.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #TAG} is neither, and that freedom is the whole reason the decisions are taken up front.</b>
 * {@code should_release} used to be evaluated inline, immediately before each module was tagged, which
 * forced the tag order to equal the decision order and so put {@code botmaker-studio} last — behind three
 * JitPack waits, even though its per-OS {@code package} matrix is the longest pole in the release and no
 * longer needs those builds to exist (it builds its upstreams from source, at the refs in its own
 * {@code .deps.env}). So the two longest CI jobs are tagged <b>first</b> and run while the JitPack chain is
 * still going:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   pilot (APK, ~3m) → studio (per-OS package matrix, ~6m)
 *     → studio-api → plugin-toolkit → plugin-host → plugin-archetype → cli → shared → session → sdk
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>And {@link Module}'s own declaration order is a third thing again — the order {@code release.sh --help}
 * lists the flags. Three orders, three jobs; none of them is a preference, and collapsing any two would be
 * the kind of change that looks like tidying and costs a release.
