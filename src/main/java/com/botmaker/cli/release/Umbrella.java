/**
 * The two writes that belong to the umbrella rather than to any module — {@code release.sh}'s pointer
 * commit and {@code push_branch}.
 *
 * <p><b>The pointer commit carries the release log in the same commit</b>, and for the same reason the
 * pointers are there at all: <i>what was released</i> and <i>whether it landed</i> are one fact, and a log
 * committed separately is a log somebody forgets to commit.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code push_branch} exists because a release that tags remote refs while leaving the branch behind
 * them local is half a release.</b> {@link CommitTagPush} pushes only the modules being released; the
 * umbrella's own pointer commit was never pushed at all, which is how the umbrella ended up 33 commits
 * ahead of {@code origin/main} with every pointer bump since 2026-08 sitting locally.
 *
 * <p><b>Order is the caller's job and it is not decorative</b>: submodules first, umbrella last, because the
 * pointer commit names submodule commits the remote must already have.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here is fatal.</b> By the time it runs every tag is pushed and every CI job is going, so
 * aborting would leave a release that is done and looks failed. It reports, exactly as
 * {@link CleanRoom} does.
