/**
 * Nudging JitPack and waiting for a tag to build — {@code release.sh}'s {@code wait_for_jitpack}.
 *
 * <p><b>The waits were removed in 2026-08 and put back on 2026-09-05, and the reversal is the part to
 * carry.</b> Pinning each upstream ref exactly (see {@link DepsEnv}) removed the <i>requirement</i> that an
 * upstream be published and newest before a downstream is tagged — JitPack resolves and builds a pinned
 * dependency tag on demand. Every clause of that is true and it still loses a race: <b>builds on demand is
 * not queues and retries</b>. {@code botmaker-cli} v0.0.9 was tagged seconds after
 * {@code botmaker-plugin-host} v0.0.5, JitPack began the CLI build while the plugin-host build was still
 * running, and it died with {@code Could not find artifact …botmaker-plugin-host:jar:v0.0.5}. A build
 * result is <b>cached per tag</b>, so that is permanent and only a new tag repairs it.
 *
 * <p>The worst property of the bug is that it fails on <i>timing</i>: another module in the same chain
 * resolved cleanly, so it reads as a JitPack outage rather than as something here. Waiting costs a few
 * minutes per link once per release; losing the race costs a whole chain and burns a tag that cannot be
 * reused.
