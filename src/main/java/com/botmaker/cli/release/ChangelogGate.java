/**
 * Every released module must describe the version being cut — {@code release.sh}'s {@code check_changelog}.
 *
 * <p><b>It invokes the module's own extractor and does not read the file itself.</b>
 * {@code <mod>/tools/changelog-section.sh} has two readers in two repositories: this gate, which asks <i>is
 * there prose for the release I am about to cut</i>, and the module's {@code ci.yml}, which asks <i>what was
 * the prose for the version that was cut</i> and feeds it to JReleaser as the release body. A release whose
 * body is extracted by a different rule than the one that gated it can pass the gate and then publish
 * something else — so there is one script, and porting it into Java here would create the second
 * implementation the file exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code --allow-unreleased} is passed here and nowhere else.</b> This side of the rename accepts a
 * {@code ## [Unreleased]} heading, because the version is not knowable while the prose is being written — it
 * is what the decide pass <i>computes</i>. {@code stamp_changelog} renames the heading a moment before the
 * tag, so the module's CI, running after it on the tag, stays strict. A fallback there could only fire if
 * the stamp had failed, and would publish a release whose notes say "Unreleased".
 *
 * <p><b>A missing extractor is refused even under {@code --force}</b>, like {@link CiDepsGate}'s unmapped
 * key and for the same reason: {@code --force} overrides a gate that failed, never one that could not run.
