/**
 * Refuse a release that forces a module the operator did not name — {@code release.sh}'s
 * {@code check_forced_but_unrequested}.
 *
 * <p><b>The forcing edges were documentation, not enforcement, until 2026-09-06.</b> Both implementations
 * evaluate a module's {@code forced} flag only for modules that were requested — {@code release.sh}'s
 * {@code decide} returns early on an empty {@code *_VER}, and {@link Plan#decide} skips a {@code null}
 * spec — so an edge whose downstream is absent from the command line does nothing at all. Every
 * <i>"a {@code --studio-api} in the same run forces it"</i> in this project's documentation quietly rests
 * on the operator having typed both flags.
 *
 * <p><b>What that cost, on 2026-09-05.</b> {@code ./release.sh --sdk 1.1.6} cut the SDK and nothing else
 * ({@code releases/2026-09-05-0128.md} has one row). The {@code SDK → STUDIO} edge exists precisely
 * because that release {@code sed}s {@code MavenService.SDK_FALLBACK_VERSION}, and with no Studio release
 * the {@code sed} never ran: Studio v1.0.37, cut eleven hours later, still pinned {@code 1.1.5} while its
 * own changelog announced {@code 1.1.6}. Every project created by that build pins the one SDK whose plugin
 * half cannot be constructed on a host without JavaFX.
 *
 * <p><b>It refuses rather than widening, and that asymmetry is the whole design.</b> Pulling the
 * downstream in automatically would cut a tag nobody named — and a pushed tag cannot be edited, which is
 * the constraint every decision in this package answers to. A refusal costs one more flag on the next
 * invocation; a wrong tag costs a release chain. So the operator is told which flag to add, with the
 * edge's own sentence as the reason, and types it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code --force} overrides it</b>, like every other gate here, because deliberately cutting an
 * upstream and bumping the downstream by hand afterwards is a real thing to want. What the flag cannot do
 * is make the omission silent: a {@link GateVerdict.Status#FORCED} line still names every edge.
