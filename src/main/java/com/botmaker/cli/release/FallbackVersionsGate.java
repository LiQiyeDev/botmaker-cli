/**
 * Refuse a Studio release whose fallback constants name a version nobody published —
 * {@code release.sh}'s {@code check_fallback_versions}.
 *
 * <p><b>A string literal in Studio's source is a pin Studio <i>writes</i> rather than a pin Studio
 * <i>has</i></b>: {@code MavenService.SDK_FALLBACK_VERSION}, which is the SDK version a freshly generated
 * bot's pom declares. It is not a dependency, so nothing in a build resolves it and no compiler, test or
 * JitPack poll can see it go wrong. It is moved by a {@code sed} over the literal on every {@code --sdk}
 * release, and the {@code sed} runs only if Studio is in that run — which is the hole {@link ForcingGate}
 * closes from the other side.
 *
 * <p>There were two until 2026-09-06. {@code TOOLKIT_FALLBACK_VERSION} went with the toolkit entry a
 * generated pom used to declare: the SDK brings the toolkit transitively at {@code compile} scope, and a
 * direct entry in the bot's pom outranked it by nearest-wins.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the failure mode of three consecutive Studio releases.</b> 1.0.34, 1.0.35 and 1.0.36 each
 * exist only because the previous one pointed the constant at an SDK tag whose JitPack build had published
 * nothing, so a bot created by that Studio could not resolve its own SDK on a first build. 1.0.37 then
 * shipped the opposite error — a tag that resolves, but the wrong one, {@code 1.1.5} where its own
 * changelog said {@code 1.1.6}.
 *
 * <p><b>What it checks is existence, not correctness</b>, and the line is drawn there deliberately.
 * <i>Which</i> SDK a new project should pin is a judgement — an older one may be the right default while a
 * newer one settles. That a tag exists is not a judgement, and it is the half that has actually gone wrong
 * four times.
 *
 * <p><b>A module being cut in this same run is exempt</b>, because the release has not {@code sed}ded yet:
 * at gate time the constant still holds the previous value, and refusing it would refuse every release that
 * moves it. The pair is the point — this gate answers for the constants nobody is about to touch, and
 * {@link ForcingGate} guarantees that a run touching one includes the Studio release that touches it.
