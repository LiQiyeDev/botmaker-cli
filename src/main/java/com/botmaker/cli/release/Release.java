/**
 * A whole release, from the decide pass to the pushed branches — the top half of {@code release.sh}'s main
 * body, as one method.
 *
 * <p><b>There is one path, and {@code --dry-run} is a {@link Runner}, not a branch through it.</b> A preview
 * decides, gates and computes exactly what a real run does and echoes the commands instead of running them.
 * That is what makes the preview worth trusting: a separate preview implementation is free to drift from the
 * release, and the drift is discovered as a tag, which cannot be edited.
 *
 * <p>The order is the script's and every step of it is load-bearing:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Decide everything up front</b> ({@link Plan}), so the tag order is free of the decisions and a
 *       refusal happens while nothing is pushed.</li>
 *   <li><b>Gate</b>, still before the first tag.</li>
 *   <li><b>Tag in {@link Order#TAG}</b> — the two longest CI jobs first, so they run while the JitPack chain
 *       is still going.</li>
 *   <li><b>Write the log the moment the last tag is pushed</b>, verdicts pending, <i>before</i> the polling
 *       — a log that only appears after the poll is missing in exactly the case worth recording.</li>
 *   <li><b>Verify, then record the pointers and push the branches</b>, umbrella last.</li>
 * </ol>
