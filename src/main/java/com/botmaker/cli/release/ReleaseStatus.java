/**
 * {@code --status [file]}: re-poll a release log that already exists.
 *
 * <p><b>Both columns, and both through the release's own readers.</b> JitPack goes through the very same
 * {@link CleanRoom} the release used — so the two can never disagree about what <i>ok</i> means, which is
 * the same reason the changelog has one extractor and two callers — and Actions through {@link Actions}.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent by construction</b>: the file is rewritten from scratch, so running it a week later
 * records what CI looks like a week later, as a reviewable diff. That is the point of committing the log at
 * all — a verdict that only ever existed in a terminal is a verdict nobody read.
 *
 * <p>Whether a {@code BROKEN} verdict should also make the command exit non-zero is <b>still open</b>, and
 * the argument against is real: no exit code can recall a pushed tag, and a red command that cannot be acted
 * on trains people to ignore it. Until that is decided this reports and exits 0, exactly as the script does.
