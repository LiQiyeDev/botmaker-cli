/**
 * What a module flag's argument means — {@code release.sh}'s {@code resolve_version}.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes and no third: a literal {@code x.y.z}, which passes through untouched, or a bump level,
 * which is applied to that module's <b>own latest tag</b>. Anything else is refused with the script's own
 * sentence, before any tag is cut, because the alternative is discovering it with other modules already
 * tagged.
 *
 * <p><b>Typed as a sealed pair rather than kept as the raw string</b>, because the two behave differently
 * everywhere downstream: an exact version is knowable without touching git, and a level is not knowable
 * until the module's tags have been read. The decide pass needs to tell those apart, and a string forces
 * every reader to re-parse it — which is how two readers end up disagreeing about {@code 1.2}.
