/**
 * Which gate runs for which module — the placement half of {@code release.sh}'s gates, and the half that is
 * a decision rather than a process.
 *
 * <p><b>All of them belong to the decide pass.</b> A gate beside a module's tag command runs when pilot and
 * studio are already tagged and their CI is already going; a refusal then has nothing to undo, because a
 * pushed tag cannot be edited. So everything here answers before the first push.
 *
 * <p>The exemptions are each a fact about a module rather than a convenience:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code botmaker-pilot} takes no gate at all. It has no {@code CHANGELOG.md} (an APK, released by its
 *       own CI, and nothing reads notes out of it), no pom pin and no JitPack build.</li>
 *   <li>{@code botmaker-studio} is exempt from the JitPack plugin gate only: JitPack never builds it — it
 *       ships installers from its own per-OS matrix — so its plugin pins are bounded by its own CI.</li>
 *   <li>The SDK-only gates are SDK-only because their subject is: {@code check_api_pointers} runs
 *       {@code ApiPointersTest} against the version being cut, and {@code check_sdk_plugin} runs the plugin
 *       registry's own validator over the SDK, which is Studio's plugin #1 with no exemption — a rule the
 *       host's own plugin breaks is a rule the gate cannot enforce on anybody else.</li>
 * </ul>
