/**
 * The {@code .deps.env} a release writes into each module that pins one — {@code release.sh}'s
 * {@code write_deps_env}.
 *
 * <p><b>It records exact refs, and that is the whole point.</b> Five of these values were once
 * {@code git ls-remote --tags | sort -V | tail -1} — "newest tag", which is only <i>usually</i> the tag this
 * release just cut. An exact ref makes a tag self-describing: checking out {@code v1.0.25} tells you which
 * upstreams it was built against.
 *
 * <p><b>The file is staged here, and the {@code git add} is load-bearing rather than tidy.</b>
 * {@link CommitTagPush} commits with {@code commit -am}, and both halves of that are blind to a file git has
 * never seen: {@code -a} stages tracked modifications only. So a module getting its <i>first</i>
 * {@code .deps.env} had it written, left on the floor, and the tag pushed without it. That is not
 * hypothetical — on 2026-09-02 the toolkit, plugin-host and the CLI were all released for the first time,
 * all three tags went out with no {@code .deps.env}, and all three JitPack builds died on
 * {@code ./.deps.env: No such file or directory} while the release reported success. A pushed tag cannot be
 * edited, so the repair was three more versions.
