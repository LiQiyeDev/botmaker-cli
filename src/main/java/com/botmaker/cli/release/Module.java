/**
 * The modules {@code release.sh} can cut a tag for — ten, and this is now the list that owns that fact.
 *
 * <p><b>Keeping the list here is the opposite of the rule {@code botmaker-dashboard} follows, and both are
 * right.</b> The dashboard refuses to keep it because it is a <i>reader</i>: a second copy there would go
 * stale against the script and be discovered as a missing module. This package is the <i>owner</i> being
 * ported — the whole point of Part C is that {@code release.sh}'s decisions move here — so the list has to
 * land somewhere, and an enum is what makes "is that a module?" a compile-time question for every caller
 * that follows.
 *
 * <p><b>Not every submodule is here, and that is the distinction the dashboard reports as <i>not released
 * by release.sh</i>.</b> {@code botmaker-gallery} and {@code botmaker-plugin-registry} are data
 * repositories with no artifact, and {@code botmaker-dashboard} is an application nothing resolves. None of
 * them has a flag, and the script answers {@code unknown arg} to one invented for them.
 *
 * <p><b>Declaration order is the script's flag order, and it is deliberately NOT the tag order.</b> The two
 * differ on purpose — the two longest CI jobs are tagged first so they run while the JitPack chain is still
 * going — and porting that order is slice 3's job. Nothing here may be read as an ordering.
