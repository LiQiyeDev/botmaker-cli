/**
 * Every module being cut must have a CI that can build it standalone — {@code release.sh}'s
 * {@code check_ci_deps}.
 *
 * <p><b>The bug it exists for is invisible from the umbrella.</b> A module's pom declares its upstreams as
 * {@code ${botmaker.<key>.version}} defaulting to {@code 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT}, which resolves for free in the
 * reactor — the upstream is a sibling module there — so {@code mvn install} at the root is green while that
 * module's own CI is red, having nothing to resolve. A module whose own CI cannot build it is a module whose
 * release job cannot publish it, and a pushed tag cannot be edited.
 *
 * <p>So the rule is: for every property this pom declares at {@code 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT}, that upstream's
 * repository name must appear somewhere in {@code .github/workflows/ci.yml}. A grep, deliberately — what is
 * being asked is <i>does this workflow know about that repository at all</i>, and a YAML parse would answer
 * a narrower question about where it appears.
 *
 * <p><b>An unmapped key is refused even under {@code --force}</b>, and that asymmetry is the point: every
 * other arm here says "this looks wrong", while an unknown {@code ${botmaker.X.version}} says the gate does
 * not know what it is looking at. Overriding a check that failed is a judgement; overriding one that could
 * not run is not.
